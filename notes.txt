//putting contditions and displaying/hiding correct links

after we are logout(or destroying the session), we are getting error in opening cart and order pages.

this is becuase without a valid session, where we reach out to user will fail becuase user object is depended on session object and session itself is not present

first thing: hide those things/ funtionalities which require session or user.
