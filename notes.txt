routes/admin.js 
app.js
routes/shope.js

express js is all about middleware
ie, incoming request will passthrough bunch of functions
thus, there will be more than request handler.
    it helps in code segreation



we can have same url for more then one webpage till the time method ccessing that webpages are different
eg: /admin/add-products => GET
    /admin/add-products => POST
    routes.get('/add-products', (req, res, next) => {
    routes.post('/add-products', (req, res, next) => {



res.sendFile('/views/addProducts.html'); 
this will cause error, as node will check for a file from root directory of and not from 
root directory of the project
thus, "path" module will be used to specify the path to html files.



<link rel="stylesheet" href="/public/css/main.css">
this will not work as node will not allow us to acces us the internal files on the browser
ie, localhost:300/public/css/main.css

to access these static files, we have to modify our main app.js file
we need to serve files statically and stically simply means that its not handles by 
router or expressjs or any other middleware.
but should be directly forwarded to file sysytem
