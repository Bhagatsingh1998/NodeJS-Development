technical errors => happens at backend and nothing much can be done as server can be down or database failer. best thing will be show the error page or sending e-mail to the administrators as soon as it happen.

expected errors => not a technical terms but these are errors which can happen if write bad code.
eg: we also have errors in our code where we interact with a user object in a place where it just can't exist or at least not in all circumstances.

We should not show a message to the user because these errors are not the users or the networks fault they are our fault.


There are areas where the error is thrown an error or is a technical object in a node application. So there is a built in error object which we can throw. That's also a javascript language features. Basically all programming languages have such a feature.

2 ways to hadle errors:
try catch : sync code
then catch : async code
in both cases, in catch block we can put our logic to handle our error or simply rediecting to some other page so that our code does not break
