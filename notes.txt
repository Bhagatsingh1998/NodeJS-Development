//Sending mail should be put in non-blocking way. As sending mail is totally different thing and sending mail can take time. 
//Thus, if we block our execution of other code till the time email is not send, then our app can lag which we donâ€™t want .
//For large apps where there is large number of mails has to be send, we can write server side scripts which will run without blocking our server req, res cycle.

// we have put the api keys in 'private folder' and importing to 'auth' controller when we need.
//this is done so that we dont post the api to github or give to someone else while sharing the folder.
